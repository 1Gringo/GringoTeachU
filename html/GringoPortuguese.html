                        <h1>Reading</h1>
                        <p>The first method is reading, reading help a lot to assimilate new word and help practice the pronunciation. Even if you don't understand all words your brain keeps this information and will make you feel you know the word just
                            because you reed it before.</p>

                        <h1>Listening</h1>
                        <p>The second method is listening, listening will improve your ears, understanding is a big part of learning language if you reed something in English and after hearing the same word, your brain will automatically do the link and
                            with constant practice, this will help a lot.</p>

                        <h1>Talking</h1>
                        <p>The third method is talking, talking is very difficult because with need to link what you are thinking and what is going out of your mouth, this is why reading and listening are very important because with repetition the words
                            will come out naturally with have to think about.</p>
